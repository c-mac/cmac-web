				Welcome to my website, dear visitors. In addition to finding basic things about me here, such as my <a href="assets/CameronMcCallie2014.pdf" target="_blank">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>
				and whatever flavors of social network I'm using, you will discover some cool (hopefully) sandboxy type widgets/games/tools/things built
				with the superheroic javascript framework known as "AngularJS" (their words, not mine!). Check out the <a ui-sref="playground">Playground!</a>
				<br>
				<br>

				At some point, the "blog" section of the site will be up and running, and will detail my many wild adventures of wrangling
				Angular code to do my bidding.
