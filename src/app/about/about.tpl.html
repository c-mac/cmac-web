			Welcome to my website, dear visitors. In addition to finding basic things about me here, such as my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and whatever flavor
			of social network I'm using, you will discover some (hopefully) cool sandboxy type widgets/games/tools/things built
			with the superheroic javascript framework known as "AngularJS" (their words, not mine!). 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			At some point, the "blog" section of the site will be up and running, and will detail my many wild adventures of wrangling
			Angular code to do my bidding.
