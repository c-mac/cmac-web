## What is this?

This is my first crack at writing my own website. Though it is probably overkill to use Josh D Miller's wonderfully crafted ng-boilerplate as a base for
a simple personal website, I am committed and passionate about learning Angular, and want to feature it heavily throughout the site!


## Special Thanks

To the creator of ng-boilerplate, Josh D Miller, and everyone who has worked on it. I am thrilled that they have open sourced this app and provided such thorough
documentation on how it is structured and how to use it.
